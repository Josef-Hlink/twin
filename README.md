# twin

A lightweight CLI tool for managing tmux sessions from TOML recipes.

Born out of the frustration of manually setting up tmux workspaces every morning.

## Requirements

- Go 1.24+
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/Josef-Hlink/twin/cmd/twin@latest
```

## Getting started

Run any twin command with no config in place and twin scaffolds a starter setup at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/twin/`
(falls back to `~/.config/twin/`).

```
$ twin tspmo
no config found — created starter config at ~/.config/twin
```

This creates:

```
~/.config/twin/
  twin.toml              # main config
  recipes/
    home.toml            # starter recipe (active by default)
    twin.toml            # meta recipe for poking around twin's own config
```

From there, add your own recipes and optionally list them as active in `twin.toml`.

## Config

Config lives at `~/.config/twin/twin.toml`.
Override the location with `TWIN_CONFIG_DIR` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

```toml
recipe-dir = "~/.config/twin/recipes"
active = ["front", "back", "infra"]
```

`active` controls which recipes `twin tspmo` spins up.

## Recipes

Each recipe is a TOML file in the recipe directory. The filename becomes the session name.

```toml
# ~/.config/twin/recipes/front.toml
start-directory = "~/Developer/pro/my-frontend/"

[[windows]]
start-directory = "src/"
commands = ["nvim"]

[[windows]]
# empty window — just a shell

[[windows]]
commands = ["lazygit"]

[[windows]]
commands = ["make run"]
```

- `start-directory` (top-level) is required
- `start-directory` on a window is relative to the recipe's top-level directory
- `commands` is optional; omit it for a plain shell
- `~` and environment variables are expanded in paths

## Subcommands

### `twin tspmo`

> Tmux Session Project Management Opener

Spin up tmux sessions for all `active` recipes. Skips sessions that already exist.

### `twin fr`

> From Recipe

Open a single recipe session.

```sh
twin fr              # fzf picker (only shows unopened recipes)
twin fr myproject    # open a specific recipe
twin fr --list       # list all available recipes
```

### `twin sybau`

> Switch Your Basis of Active Undertakement

Fuzzy session switcher in a tmux popup. Bind it in `tmux.conf`:

```
bind-key Space run-shell "twin sybau --preview"
```

## Disclaimer

This project is entirely vibecoded. Virtually none of the code is written by me — it's all Claude.
